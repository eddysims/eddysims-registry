Welcome to Eddy Sims Registry! This is a component registry built with the shadcn/ui registry system, allowing you to easily install and use components across your projects.

## Quick Start

Install components directly from this registry using the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://registry.eddysims.com/r/star-rating
```

## Available Components

Browse our collection of components:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Star Rating" href="/docs/components/star-rating" />
  <Card title="More components coming soon..." href="#" />
</Cards>

## How It Works

This registry uses the shadcn/ui registry system to distribute components. When you install a component:

1. The component files are copied to your project
2. Dependencies are automatically installed
3. You get full control over the code

## Features

- 🚀 **Easy Installation**: One command to install any component
- 🎨 **Customizable**: Full control over styling and behavior
- 📚 **Well Documented**: Each component comes with examples and API docs
- 🔧 **TypeScript**: Built with TypeScript for better DX
- ♿ **Accessible**: Components follow accessibility best practices

## Registry Structure

Components are organized in the following structure:

```
registry/
├── default/
│   ├── star-rating/
│   │   └── star-rating.tsx
│   └── ...
└── public/r/
    ├── star-rating.json
    └── ...
```
